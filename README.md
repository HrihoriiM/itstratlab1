# Back4App Ticketlister Application- backend

#### The relevant code you will need is found in [cloud/main.js](cloud/main.js)


You can also run this server locally. You need to have [Mongo installed](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/), with [Mongod running](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/manage-mongodb-processes/)


```
git clone https://github.com/considine/ticketlister.git
cd ticketlister
npm install
npm run start
```


Conversely, you can test right on Back4App. Create a new project and upload main.js as your cloud code

See their [getting started guide](https://www.back4app.com/docs/platform/command-line-tool/connect-to-back4app) for more help on this
